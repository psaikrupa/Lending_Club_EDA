## Case Study

### Company Background Information

> This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.  

### Business Understanding 

> Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 

> When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
  > 1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

  > 2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company


## Business Objectives

> The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 


## Data Set

> The data set is a csv file, it contains the complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 to 2011.

## Conclusions

Major Driving Factors for loan defaults<br>
Home Ownership – Borrowers whose home ownership values are rent or mortgage have a higher risk of defaulting loans.<br>
Purpose – If the purpose of the loan is debt consolidation, there is a higher probability of defaulting loans.<br>
Income Verification – If the income is not verified, higher the risk of default.<br>
Work Experience – Borrowers with work experience range between 0-1 and 10+ years have had a higher default loan amount value.<br>
Issue Month – Loans issued during the months of December, January have higher default loan amounts.<br>
Loan Amounts – Borrowers who took loans for amounts in the range of 4K-12K have defaulted more.<br>

Major Driving Factors for loan sanctions<br>
Interest Rate & Purpose – In the past, higher interest loans had been sanctioned for purposes like small business, house, debt consolidation. The Finance company can look at loan applicants for these purposes for higher interest rates and hence higher income.<br>
Grade – Applicants from Grade A have less defaulted loans. Company can look to sanction loans to applicants in Grade A<br>
